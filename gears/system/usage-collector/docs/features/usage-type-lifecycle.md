## 1. Feature Context

### 1.1 Overview

Provides the operator-driven lifecycle for UsageType definitions — register, list, get, and delete. The platform-global usage-type catalog, persisted in the active storage plugin's database and managed via the Plugin SPI, exists as a single authoritative surface that the ingestion path consults for kind-and-existence enforcement and the query path consults for UsageType validation, with PDP-gated mutations.

### 1.2 Purpose

This feature exists so the operator-controlled usage-type catalog is the single authoritative surface for UsageType existence, UsageType semantics (carried by the closed `kind: UsageKind` enum), and the closed `metadata_fields` declaration across the gear: registration and deletion are gated by per-component PDP enforcement so only authorized platform operators can mutate the catalog; UsageType existence and `metadata_fields` lookups on the ingestion hot path dispatch a `get_usage_type` SPI call against the bound storage plugin per record.

**Requirements**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-fr-usage-type-registration`, `cpt-cf-usage-collector-fr-usage-type-deletion`, `cpt-cf-usage-collector-fr-counter-semantics`, `cpt-cf-usage-collector-fr-gauge-semantics`, `cpt-cf-usage-collector-nfr-availability`

**Principles**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-principle-semantics-enforcement`

| `cpt-cf-usage-collector-actor-platform-operator`  | Registers and deletes UsageType definitions via either the REST surface (`POST /usage-collector/v1/usage-types`, `DELETE /usage-collector/v1/usage-types/{gts_id}`) or the SDK trait methods `UsageCollectorClientV1::create_usage_type` / `delete_usage_type`; sole mutator of the platform-global usage-type catalog, gated by PDP authorization                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

### 1.5 Explicit Non-Applicability

- **UX** (`UX-FDESIGN-001` user journey, `UX-FDESIGN-002` accessibility): Not applicable because the usage-type-lifecycle feature is a backend surface reachable via both the public REST contract (`POST/DELETE/GET /usage-collector/v1/usage-types`) and the in-process SDK trait `UsageCollectorClientV1::create_usage_type` / `delete_usage_type` / `list_usage_types` / `get_usage_type`, and is consumed by callers in-process via per-record `get_usage_type` SPI round-trips against `cpt-cf-usage-collector-contract-storage-plugin`; there is no human-facing UI in this gear, and any UI consumption of UsageType definitions is delivered by upstream products outside this scope. User-friendliness on the operator surface is encoded through the deterministic `Problem` error envelopes published by `usage-collector-v1.yaml` (REST) and the flat `UsageCollectorError` enum (SDK).

## 2. Actor Flows (CDSL)

### Register UsageType

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-flow-usage-type-lifecycle-register-usage-type`

**Actor**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-actor-platform-operator`

**Success Scenarios**:

- A platform operator submits a UsageType definition (`gts_id` ending `~` and deriving from the reserved abstract base `gts.cf.core.uc.usage_record.v1~` with at least one further `~`-separated segment, `kind: UsageKind` — closed counter / gauge enum, and a closed `metadata_fields: array<string>` declaring the allowed metadata key names) either via `POST /usage-collector/v1/usage-types` or via the SDK trait method `UsageCollectorClientV1::create_usage_type`; the REST handler receives `Extension<SecurityContext>` populated by ToolKit gateway middleware (`OperationBuilder::authenticated()`) (or, on the SDK path, the in-process trait impl receives `&SecurityContext` directly) and delegates to the gateway UsageType Catalog service, the gateway service invokes the per-component `authorize` helper (`PolicyEnforcer::access_scope_with(ctx, ...)` against `cpt-cf-usage-collector-contract-authz-resolver`) to authorize the register operation, the gateway validates the `metadata_fields` shape (the `gts_id` base-derivation check is owned upstream by `UsageTypeGtsId::new` on the REST handler's `String` `gts_id` field or by the typed `UsageTypeGtsId` argument on the SDK path; `kind` is validated as a closed `UsageKind` enum at the serde deserialize boundary), the gateway dispatches the catalog write through `cpt-cf-usage-collector-contract-storage-plugin` (the plugin persists the new row in `usage_type_catalog` inside a transaction with the unique constraint on `gts_id` rejecting duplicates, and the row carries `kind` and `metadata_fields` verbatim), and the canonical `UsageType` resource is returned with a `Location` header per `usage-collector-v1.yaml`.

**Error Scenarios**:

- PDP denies the register operation — propagated platform-authorization error envelope from `cpt-cf-usage-collector-flow-foundation-pdp-authorize` (per-component `authorize` helper against `cpt-cf-usage-collector-contract-authz-resolver`); no catalog mutation occurs.
- Type shape is invalid in one of three distinct ways: (a) the supplied `gts_id` does not derive from the reserved abstract base `gts.cf.core.uc.usage_record.v1~`, is empty, or is missing a derivation segment after the reserved base — the REST handler lifts the failed `UsageTypeGtsId::new` conversion into the canonical `InvalidArgument` `Problem` envelope (HTTP `400`, `field_violations[0].field="gts_id"`, `.reason="INVALID_BASE_GTS_ID"`, `.description` echoing the rejected identifier) before any plugin dispatch; (b) `kind` carries an unknown value (anything other than `"counter"` or `"gauge"`) — the REST handler lifts the failed `UsageKind::from_str` parse into the canonical `InvalidArgument` `Problem` envelope (HTTP `400`, `field_violations[0].field="kind"`, `.reason="VALIDATION"`) before any plugin dispatch; (c) `metadata_fields` is malformed (missing, not an array of strings, contains empty strings, or contains duplicates) — actionable fields-validation envelope (HTTP `400`, `field_violations[0].field="metadata_fields[{i}]"`, `.reason` one of `INVALID_METADATA_FIELDS_EMPTY_STRING` / `INVALID_METADATA_FIELDS_DUPLICATE`) is returned before any plugin dispatch.
- Duplicate `gts_id` already present in the plugin's `usage_type_catalog` table — the unique constraint surfaces a `UsageTypeAlreadyExists` SPI error which the gateway returns as an actionable conflict error envelope (HTTP `409`).
- Plugin transport or persistence failure — propagated as a deterministic platform error envelope (HTTP `503` for `PluginUnavailable` / `TypesRegistryUnavailable` / `ServiceUnavailable` (plugin-side `Transient` and host-side per-call deadline expirations both lift to `ServiceUnavailable`); HTTP `500` for plugin `BackendError` (lifted to `Internal`)); no synthesized UsageType handle.

**Steps**:

1. [x] - `p1` - Operator submits the register request via either `POST /usage-collector/v1/usage-types` or `UsageCollectorClientV1::create_usage_type` (SDK trait); both surfaces accept a resolved `SecurityContext` (REST: `Extension<SecurityContext>` populated by ToolKit gateway middleware via `OperationBuilder::authenticated()`; SDK: `&SecurityContext` argument) and W3C audit-correlation context, and both converge on the same gateway domain service - `inst-register-usage-type-submit`
2. [x] - `p1` - Delegate to the gateway UsageType Catalog service (the REST handler and the SDK trait impl share the same domain service entry point), passing the inbound `SecurityContext` and the register-operation payload (`gts_id`, `metadata_fields`) - `inst-register-usage-type-service-call`
3. [x] - `p1` - Inside the gateway service, invoke `cpt-cf-usage-collector-flow-foundation-pdp-authorize` via the per-component `authorize` helper (`PolicyEnforcer::access_scope_with(ctx, ...)` against `cpt-cf-usage-collector-contract-authz-resolver`) with the register-operation attribution tuple and receive (`PdpDecision`, `PdpConstraint` set) - `inst-register-usage-type-pdp`
4. [x] - `p1` - **IF** the PDP decision is deny **RETURN** the propagated platform-authorization error envelope (HTTP `403` per the yaml `Problem` response shape) - `inst-register-usage-type-pdp-deny`
5. [x] - `p1` - Invoke `cpt-cf-usage-collector-algo-usage-type-lifecycle-usage-type-shape-validation` against the submitted payload (`metadata_fields` shape — array of unique non-empty strings). `gts_id` form and kind-prefix membership are pre-validated at the `UsageTypeGtsId::new` boundary (the REST handler runs the conversion on the permissive `CreateUsageTypeRequest::gts_id` DTO field before this step; the SDK trait's typed `gts_id: UsageTypeGtsId` argument carries the same guarantee), so this algorithm sees only well-typed identifiers - `inst-register-usage-type-validate-shape`
6. [x] - `p1` - **IF** the shape-validation algorithm reports invalid **RETURN** the actionable `InvalidArgument` `Problem` (HTTP `400`, `field_violations[0].field="metadata_fields[{index}]"`, `.reason` ∈ {`INVALID_METADATA_FIELDS_EMPTY_STRING`, `INVALID_METADATA_FIELDS_DUPLICATE`}) before any plugin dispatch - `inst-register-usage-type-invalid-shape`
7. [x] - `p1` - **TRY** dispatch the catalog write through `cpt-cf-usage-collector-contract-storage-plugin` carrying (`gts_id`, `metadata_fields`); the plugin persists the new row in `usage_type_catalog` (PK `gts_id`) inside a transaction with `metadata_fields` stored as a typed array of strings - `inst-register-usage-type-spi-insert`
8. [x] - `p1` - **CATCH** plugin SPI error - `inst-register-usage-type-spi-catch`
   1. [x] - `p1` - **IF** the error is `UsageTypeAlreadyExists` (the plugin's unique constraint on `gts_id` fired) **RETURN** the canonical `AlreadyExists` envelope (HTTP `409`, `context.resource_type="gts.cf.core.uc.usage_type.v1~"`, `context.resource.name=<gts_id>` echoing the offending identifier) - `inst-register-usage-type-duplicate`
   2. [x] - `p1` - **ELSE** (transport / availability / persistence error from the plugin) **RETURN** the propagated platform-error envelope (HTTP `503` for `PluginUnavailable` / `TypesRegistryUnavailable` / `ServiceUnavailable` (plugin-side `Transient` and host-side per-call deadline expirations both lift to `ServiceUnavailable`); HTTP `500` for plugin `BackendError` (lifted to `Internal`)) - `inst-register-usage-type-spi-fail`
9. [x] - `p1` - **RETURN** HTTP `201` with the canonical `UsageType` resource body (as the `UsageTypeDto` REST projection) and `Location: /usage-collector/v1/usage-types/{gts_id}` per `usage-collector-v1.yaml` (or, on the SDK path, return `Ok(UsageType)` to the trait caller) - `inst-register-usage-type-return`

**Acceptance Scenarios (Given-When-Then)**:

- **Given** the catalog has no row for the proposed `gts_id`, **when** an operator calls `POST /usage-collector/v1/usage-types` with `gts_id` ending `~` and deriving from the reserved abstract base `gts.cf.core.uc.usage_record.v1~`, plus `kind: UsageKind` (counter / gauge) and a valid closed `metadata_fields: array<string>`, **then** the gateway runs PDP and `metadata_fields` shape-validation (both pass), the plugin persists the new row in `usage_type_catalog` carrying `gts_id`, `kind`, and `metadata_fields`, and HTTP `201` is returned with the canonical `UsageType` resource (as `UsageTypeDto`) and a `Location` header.
- **Given** the catalog already contains a row keyed by the submitted `gts_id`, **when** an operator calls `POST /usage-collector/v1/usage-types` with the same `gts_id`, **then** the plugin's unique constraint on `gts_id` fires, the gateway returns HTTP `409` with the canonical `AlreadyExists` envelope (`Problem.context.resource_type="gts.cf.core.uc.usage_type.v1~"`, `Problem.context.resource.name` carrying the offending identifier), and no row mutation occurs.

### Delete UsageType

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-flow-usage-type-lifecycle-delete-usage-type`

**Actor**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-actor-platform-operator`

**Success Scenarios**:

- A platform operator submits the delete request via either `DELETE /usage-collector/v1/usage-types/{gts_id}` or the SDK trait method `UsageCollectorClientV1::delete_usage_type` (both surfaces converge on the same gateway domain service); the gateway UsageType Catalog service authorizes the delete via the per-component `authorize` helper against `cpt-cf-usage-collector-contract-authz-resolver`, dispatches the catalog delete through `cpt-cf-usage-collector-contract-storage-plugin`, the plugin's in-database `ON DELETE RESTRICT` foreign key from `usage_records.gts_id` to `usage_type_catalog(gts_id)` confirms zero references and the plugin removes the row inside the same transaction, and `204 No Content` (REST) or `Ok(())` (SDK) is returned.

**Error Scenarios**:

- Request arrives without a resolved `SecurityContext` (gateway middleware rejected upstream) — the canonical `Unauthenticated` `Problem` envelope is returned by the gateway; no catalog mutation occurs.
- PDP denies the delete operation — propagated platform-authorization error envelope from `cpt-cf-usage-collector-flow-foundation-pdp-authorize` (per-component `authorize` helper against `cpt-cf-usage-collector-contract-authz-resolver`).
- UsageType `gts_id` not present in the plugin's `usage_type_catalog` table — the plugin surfaces `UsageTypeNotFound` and the gateway returns the canonical not-found `Problem` envelope (HTTP `404`, `resource.type="usage_type"`, `resource.id=<gts_id>`; the canonical envelope does not carry a top-level `Problem.context.reason` here).
- Plugin's FK rejects the delete because at least one `usage_records` row references the target `gts_id` — the plugin surfaces `UsageTypeReferenced { gts_id, sample_ref_count }` and the gateway returns the canonical conflict `Problem` envelope (HTTP `409`, `reason="USAGE_TYPE_REFERENCED"`, `resource.type="usage_type"`, `resource.id=<gts_id>`, `detail` carrying the human-readable reference count); `sample_ref_count` is conveyed in the `detail` string only and is NOT exposed as a structured `context.sample_ref_count` field (referential-delete).
- Plugin transport or persistence failure — propagated as a deterministic platform error envelope (HTTP `503` for `PluginUnavailable` / `TypesRegistryUnavailable` / `ServiceUnavailable` (plugin-side `Transient` and host-side per-call deadline expirations both lift to `ServiceUnavailable`); HTTP `500` for plugin `BackendError` (lifted to `Internal`)).

**Steps** (the referential-delete protocol):

1. [x] - `p1` - Operator submits the delete request via either `DELETE /usage-collector/v1/usage-types/{gts_id}` or `UsageCollectorClientV1::delete_usage_type` (SDK trait); both surfaces accept a resolved `SecurityContext` and W3C audit-correlation context, both converge on the same gateway domain service, and the gateway service invokes `cpt-cf-usage-collector-flow-foundation-pdp-authorize` via the per-component `authorize` helper (`PolicyEnforcer::access_scope_with(ctx, ...)` against `cpt-cf-usage-collector-contract-authz-resolver`) with the delete-operation attribution tuple; **IF** the PDP decision is deny **RETURN** the propagated platform-authorization error envelope (HTTP `403`) - `inst-delete-usage-type-pdp-authorize`
2. [x] - `p1` - Dispatch the catalog delete through `cpt-cf-usage-collector-contract-storage-plugin` carrying the target `gts_id`; the plugin enters a transaction, the `ON DELETE RESTRICT` foreign key on `usage_records.gts_id` → `usage_type_catalog(gts_id)` either allows the row removal (zero references) or rejects the delete with a structured `UsageTypeReferenced` error inside the same transaction - `inst-delete-usage-type-spi-dispatch`
3. [x] - `p1` - **CATCH** plugin SPI error - `inst-delete-usage-type-spi-catch`
   1. [x] - `p1` - **IF** the error is `UsageTypeNotFound` (no `usage_type_catalog` row exists for the target `gts_id`) **RETURN** the canonical not-found `Problem` envelope (HTTP `404`, `resource.type="usage_type"`, `resource.id=<gts_id>`) - `inst-delete-usage-type-not-found`
   2. [x] - `p1` - **IF** the error is `UsageTypeReferenced { gts_id, sample_ref_count }` (the plugin's FK rejected the delete because at least one `usage_records` row references the `gts_id`) **RETURN** the canonical conflict `Problem` envelope (HTTP `409`, `reason="USAGE_TYPE_REFERENCED"`, `resource.type="usage_type"`, `resource.id=<gts_id>`, `detail` carrying the human-readable reference count); the `sample_ref_count` is conveyed in `detail` only and is NOT exposed as a structured `context.sample_ref_count` field - `inst-delete-usage-type-referenced`
   3. [x] - `p1` - **ELSE** (transport / availability / persistence error from the plugin) **RETURN** the propagated platform-error envelope (HTTP `503` for `PluginUnavailable` / `TypesRegistryUnavailable` / `ServiceUnavailable`; HTTP `500` for plugin `BackendError` lifted to `Internal`) - `inst-delete-usage-type-spi-fail`
4. [x] - `p1` - On a successful delete, **RETURN** HTTP `204 No Content` (REST) or `Ok(())` (SDK trait) per `usage-collector-v1.yaml` - `inst-delete-usage-type-spi-delete-return`

**Acceptance Scenarios (Given-When-Then)**:

- **Given** the plugin's `usage_type_catalog` table holds a row for `gts_id = G` and the plugin's `usage_records` table holds zero rows whose `gts_id = G`, **when** an operator calls `DELETE /usage-collector/v1/usage-types/{gts_id}` (or `UsageCollectorClientV1::delete_usage_type`) for `G`, **then** the gateway runs PDP (passes), the plugin's FK confirms zero references and removes the row inside the same transaction, HTTP `204 No Content` (REST) or `Ok(())` (SDK) is returned, and no other row in either table is mutated.
- **Given** the plugin's `usage_type_catalog` table holds a row for `gts_id = G` and the plugin's `usage_records` table holds at least one row whose `gts_id = G`, **when** an operator calls `DELETE /usage-collector/v1/usage-types/{gts_id}` (or `UsageCollectorClientV1::delete_usage_type`) for `G`, **then** the plugin's `ON DELETE RESTRICT` foreign key rejects the delete inside the same transaction and surfaces `UsageTypeReferenced { gts_id: G, sample_ref_count }` to the gateway, the gateway returns the canonical conflict `Problem` envelope (HTTP `409`, `reason="USAGE_TYPE_REFERENCED"`, `resource.type="usage_type"`, `resource.id=G`, `detail` carrying the human-readable reference count), no `usage_type_catalog` row is removed, and no `usage_records` row is mutated.

### List UsageTypes

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-flow-usage-type-lifecycle-list-usage-types`

**Actor**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-actor-platform-developer`

**Success Scenarios**:

- A platform developer (any authorized REST caller, or any in-process SDK consumer) submits the list request via either `GET /usage-collector/v1/usage-types` with optional `limit` and `cursor` paging parameters or `UsageCollectorClientV1::list_usage_types` (SDK trait) with a `&ODataQuery` argument carrying the same optional `limit` and `cursor`; both surfaces converge on the same gateway domain service, the gateway service authorizes the read via the per-component `authorize` helper against `cpt-cf-usage-collector-contract-authz-resolver`, the page is composed from a paginated catalog read dispatched through `cpt-cf-usage-collector-contract-storage-plugin` against the plugin's `usage_type_catalog` table, and a `toolkit_odata::Page<UsageType>` is returned (REST projects each item to `UsageTypeDto` for the wire response; SDK returns the SDK-side `UsageType` directly) per `usage-collector-v1.yaml`.

**Error Scenarios**:

- Request arrives without a resolved `SecurityContext` (gateway middleware rejected upstream) — the canonical `Unauthenticated` `Problem` envelope is returned by the gateway.
- PDP denies the read operation — propagated platform-authorization error envelope from `cpt-cf-usage-collector-flow-foundation-pdp-authorize` (per-component `authorize` helper against `cpt-cf-usage-collector-contract-authz-resolver`).
- Plugin SPI transport or persistence failure on the paginated catalog read — propagated as a deterministic platform error envelope (HTTP `503` for `PluginUnavailable` / `TypesRegistryUnavailable` / `ServiceUnavailable` (plugin-side `Transient` and host-side per-call deadline expirations both lift to `ServiceUnavailable`); HTTP `500` for plugin `BackendError` (lifted to `Internal`)).

**Steps**:

1. [x] - `p1` - Caller submits the list request via either `GET /usage-collector/v1/usage-types` with optional `limit` and `cursor` paging parameters per the yaml schema or `UsageCollectorClientV1::list_usage_types(ctx, &ODataQuery)` (SDK trait), with the `ODataQuery` carrying the same optional `limit` and `cursor`; both surfaces accept a resolved `SecurityContext` and W3C audit-correlation context - `inst-list-usage-types-submit`
2. [x] - `p1` - Delegate to the gateway UsageType Catalog service (the REST handler and the SDK trait impl share the same domain service entry point), passing the inbound `SecurityContext` and the paging parameters - `inst-list-usage-types-service-call`
3. [x] - `p1` - Inside the gateway service, invoke `cpt-cf-usage-collector-flow-foundation-pdp-authorize` via the per-component `authorize` helper (`PolicyEnforcer::access_scope_with(ctx, ...)` against `cpt-cf-usage-collector-contract-authz-resolver`) with the read-operation attribution tuple and receive (`PdpDecision`, `PdpConstraint` set) - `inst-list-usage-types-pdp`
4. [x] - `p1` - **IF** the PDP decision is deny **RETURN** the propagated platform-authorization error envelope (HTTP `403`) - `inst-list-usage-types-pdp-deny`
5. [x] - `p1` - Dispatch the paginated catalog read through `cpt-cf-usage-collector-contract-storage-plugin` against the plugin's `usage_type_catalog` table and compose the requested page from the returned rows - `inst-list-usage-types-plugin-read`
6. [x] - `p1` - **RETURN** HTTP `200` with the populated `toolkit_odata::Page<UsageTypeDto>` envelope (next-cursor included via `page_info.next_cursor` per `usage-collector-v1.yaml`) on the REST path, or `Ok(toolkit_odata::Page<UsageType>)` on the SDK path - `inst-list-usage-types-return`

### Read UsageType

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-flow-usage-type-lifecycle-get-usage-type`

**Actor**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-actor-platform-developer`

**Success Scenarios**:

- A platform developer (any authorized REST caller, or any in-process SDK consumer) submits the get request via either `GET /usage-collector/v1/usage-types/{gts_id}` or `UsageCollectorClientV1::get_usage_type(ctx, gts_id)` (SDK trait); both surfaces converge on the same gateway domain service, the gateway service authorizes the read via the per-component `authorize` helper against `cpt-cf-usage-collector-contract-authz-resolver`, a catalog get is dispatched through `cpt-cf-usage-collector-contract-storage-plugin`, and the canonical `UsageType` resource is returned (REST projects to `UsageTypeDto` for the wire response; SDK returns the SDK-side `UsageType` directly) per `usage-collector-v1.yaml`.

**Error Scenarios**:

- Request arrives without a resolved `SecurityContext` (gateway middleware rejected upstream) — the canonical `Unauthenticated` `Problem` envelope is returned by the gateway.
- PDP denies the read operation — propagated platform-authorization error envelope from `cpt-cf-usage-collector-flow-foundation-pdp-authorize` (per-component `authorize` helper against `cpt-cf-usage-collector-contract-authz-resolver`).
- The requested `gts_id` is absent from the `usage_type_catalog` table — the canonical not-found `Problem` envelope (HTTP `404`, `resource.type="usage_type"`, `resource.id=<gts_id>`) is returned.
- Plugin SPI transport or persistence failure on the catalog get dispatch — propagated as a deterministic platform error envelope (HTTP `503` for `PluginUnavailable` / `TypesRegistryUnavailable` / `ServiceUnavailable` (plugin-side `Transient` and host-side per-call deadline expirations both lift to `ServiceUnavailable`); HTTP `500` for plugin `BackendError` (lifted to `Internal`)).

**Steps**:

1. [x] - `p1` - Caller submits the get request via either `GET /usage-collector/v1/usage-types/{gts_id}` or `UsageCollectorClientV1::get_usage_type(ctx, gts_id)` (SDK trait); both surfaces accept a resolved `SecurityContext` and W3C audit-correlation context - `inst-get-usage-type-submit`
2. [x] - `p1` - Delegate to the gateway UsageType Catalog service (the REST handler and the SDK trait impl share the same domain service entry point), passing the inbound `SecurityContext` and the target `gts_id` - `inst-get-usage-type-service-call`
3. [x] - `p1` - Inside the gateway service, invoke `cpt-cf-usage-collector-flow-foundation-pdp-authorize` via the per-component `authorize` helper (`PolicyEnforcer::access_scope_with(ctx, ...)` against `cpt-cf-usage-collector-contract-authz-resolver`) with the read-operation attribution tuple (including the target `gts_id`) and receive (`PdpDecision`, `PdpConstraint` set) - `inst-get-usage-type-pdp`
4. [x] - `p1` - **IF** the PDP decision is deny **RETURN** the propagated platform-authorization error envelope (HTTP `403`) - `inst-get-usage-type-pdp-deny`
5. [x] - `p1` - Dispatch the catalog get through `cpt-cf-usage-collector-contract-storage-plugin` for the supplied `gts_id` - `inst-get-usage-type-repo-find-by-id`
6. [x] - `p1` - **IF** the plugin returns `Err(UsageTypeNotFound { gts_id })` (no row for the supplied `gts_id`) the gateway lifts to `UsageCollectorError::NotFound { .. }` and **RETURNS** the canonical not-found `Problem` envelope (HTTP `404`, `resource.type="usage_type"`, `resource.id=<gts_id>`) - `inst-get-usage-type-not-found`
7. [x] - `p1` - **RETURN** HTTP `200` with the canonical `UsageType` resource projected to `UsageTypeDto` for the wire response (`gts_id` as `String`, `kind: UsageKind`, `metadata_fields: Vec<String>` — every field of the SDK `UsageType` struct, see `usage-collector-sdk/src/models.rs`) per `usage-collector-v1.yaml` (or `Ok(UsageType)` on the SDK path) - `inst-get-usage-type-return`

## 3. Processes / Business Logic (CDSL)

### UsageType Shape Validation

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-algo-usage-type-lifecycle-usage-type-shape-validation`

**Input**: a well-typed `UsageType` (carrying `gts_id: UsageTypeGtsId`, `kind: UsageKind`, and `metadata_fields: Vec<String>`) from `cpt-cf-usage-collector-flow-usage-type-lifecycle-register-usage-type`. `gts_id` is pre-validated by `UsageTypeGtsId::new` upstream (the REST handler runs the conversion on the permissive `CreateUsageTypeRequest::gts_id` DTO field; the SDK trait's typed `gts_id: UsageTypeGtsId` argument carries the same guarantee), so this algorithm sees only identifiers deriving from the reserved abstract base `gts.cf.core.uc.usage_record.v1~` with at least one further `~`-separated segment. `kind` is pre-validated as a closed `UsageKind` enum upstream (the REST handler parses the permissive `CreateUsageTypeRequest::kind` DTO field via `UsageKind::from_str`; the SDK trait's typed `kind: UsageKind` argument carries the same guarantee), so unknown values are rejected before this algorithm runs.

**Output**: `valid` (the payload is ready for plugin dispatch), or a structured `InvalidArgument` `Problem` (HTTP `400`, `field_violations[0].field="metadata_fields[{index}]"`, `.reason` ∈ {`INVALID_METADATA_FIELDS_EMPTY_STRING`, `INVALID_METADATA_FIELDS_DUPLICATE`}) citing the offending entry per the `Problem` shape in `usage-collector-v1.yaml`. This algorithm performs structural validation of `metadata_fields` only — duplicate-`gts_id` detection is owned by the plugin's unique constraint on `usage_type_catalog(gts_id)` (surfaced as `UsageTypeAlreadyExists`), NOT by this algorithm. Invalid-base violations on a candidate `gts_id` are caught earlier at `UsageTypeGtsId::new` and surface as `UsageCollectorError::InvalidArgument` (`ValidationReason::InvalidBaseGtsId`); they never reach this algorithm.

**Steps**:

1. [x] - `p1` - **IF** the `metadata_fields` field contains an empty string or a duplicate, **RETURN** the structured `InvalidArgument` `Problem` with `field_violations[0].field="metadata_fields[{index}]"` and `.reason` ∈ {`INVALID_METADATA_FIELDS_EMPTY_STRING`, `INVALID_METADATA_FIELDS_DUPLICATE`} of the offending entry - `inst-algo-shape-invalid-metadata-fields`
2. [x] - `p1` - **RETURN** `valid`; the payload is ready for plugin dispatch by `cpt-cf-usage-collector-flow-usage-type-lifecycle-register-usage-type` - `inst-algo-shape-return-valid`

### Ingest Metadata Validation

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-algo-usage-type-lifecycle-ingest-metadata-validation`

**Input**: target `gts_id` (resolved from the incoming usage row) and the candidate `metadata` JSON object as supplied by the ingest call.

**Output**: `valid` (every key in the candidate `metadata` is a declared member of the usage type's `metadata_fields`; all values are conveyed as `String`), or a structured `UnknownMetadataKey { gts_id, key }` error lifted to a `Problem` envelope whose `field_violations[*]` carries the offending key (HTTP `400`, `field_violations[0].reason="UNKNOWN_METADATA_KEY"`, `field_violations[0].field="metadata.<key>"`) per the `Problem` shape in `usage-collector-v1.yaml`. The lookup of `metadata_fields` comes from the plugin SoR via a direct `get_usage_type` dispatch against `cpt-cf-usage-collector-contract-storage-plugin`. This validation is **closed-shape**: there is no free-form remainder and undeclared keys are never silently preserved.

**Steps**:

1. [x] - `p1` - Resolve the `metadata_fields` set for the target `gts_id` by dispatching `get_usage_type(gts_id)` against `cpt-cf-usage-collector-contract-storage-plugin`; **IF** the plugin returns `Err(UsageTypeNotFound { gts_id })` **RETURN** the `UsageTypeNotFound { gts_id }` error (lifted by the ingest flow to the canonical not-found `Problem` envelope, HTTP `404`, `resource.type="usage_type"`, `resource.id=<gts_id>`) so the ingest path can reject the row before any plugin write dispatch — the SDK collapses ingestion-path and catalog-admin misses into the single `UsageTypeNotFound` variant per `error.rs` - `inst-algo-ingest-validate-resolve-fields`
2. [x] - `p1` - Validate the candidate `metadata` object against the resolved `metadata_fields` by checking that every key in the candidate is a member of the closed `metadata_fields` array; values are accepted as `String` end-to-end - `inst-algo-ingest-validate-closed-shape`
3. [x] - `p1` - **IF** the candidate carries any key that is not a member of `metadata_fields` **RETURN** `UnknownMetadataKey { gts_id, key }`, lifted by the ingest flow to a canonical `Problem` envelope (HTTP `400`, `field_violations[0].reason="UNKNOWN_METADATA_KEY"`, `field_violations[0].field="metadata"` carrying the offending key in the human-readable detail) so the caller can pinpoint the offending key — note: the offending key is conveyed via `field_violations[*]`, NOT via a top-level `Problem.context.reason="unknown_metadata_key"` discriminator - `inst-algo-ingest-validate-reject`
4. [x] - `p1` - **RETURN** `valid`; the candidate metadata may now flow to the plugin's usage-record insert path - `inst-algo-ingest-validate-return-valid`

**Acceptance Scenarios (Given-When-Then)**:

- **Given** a registered UsageType `T` whose `metadata_fields = ["region"]`, **when** any caller submits a usage row carrying `gts_id = T` and `metadata = { "region": "eu-west-1" }`, **then** the gateway resolves the declared keys via a plugin SoR round-trip, verifies that every candidate key is a member of `metadata_fields` (passes), and accepts the row for plugin dispatch (closed-shape validation).
- **Given** a registered UsageType `T` whose `metadata_fields = ["region"]`, **when** any caller submits a usage row carrying `gts_id = T` and `metadata = { "region": "eu-west-1", "extra_tag": "x" }`, **then** the gateway returns HTTP `400` with a `Problem` envelope whose `field_violations[0].reason = "UNKNOWN_METADATA_KEY"` and `field_violations[0].field = "metadata.extra_tag"`, no plugin write dispatch occurs, and no `usage_records` row is mutated.

## 4. States (CDSL)

### UsageType Registration Lifecycle State Machine

- [x] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-state-usage-type-lifecycle-usage-type-registration-lifecycle`

**States**: `not-registered`, `registered`

**Initial State**: `not-registered`

**Scope note**: This state machine models the lifecycle of a `gts_id` in the unified usage-type catalog persisted in the plugin's database. Registration and deletion go through the REST surface or the SDK trait surface; both surfaces converge on the same gateway domain service which dispatches catalog writes through `cpt-cf-usage-collector-contract-storage-plugin`.

**Transitions**:

1. [x] - `p1` - **FROM** `not-registered` **TO** `registered` **WHEN** `cpt-cf-usage-collector-flow-usage-type-lifecycle-register-usage-type` completes successfully — the plugin SPI catalog-insert persisted the new row in the plugin's `usage_type_catalog` table inside a transaction (mirrors `inst-register-usage-type-spi-insert`) - `inst-state-usage-type-lifecycle-registered`
2. [x] - `p1` - **FROM** `registered` **TO** `not-registered` **WHEN** `cpt-cf-usage-collector-flow-usage-type-lifecycle-delete-usage-type` completes successfully — the plugin SPI catalog-delete removed the row from the plugin's `usage_type_catalog` table after the `ON DELETE RESTRICT` foreign key confirmed zero `usage_records` references (mirrors `inst-delete-usage-type-spi-delete-return`); the transition is REJECTED while the plugin's FK reports at least one `usage_records` row references the `gts_id` (the plugin returns `UsageTypeReferenced` and the gateway returns the canonical conflict `Problem` envelope at HTTP `409`), and the state remains `registered` - `inst-state-usage-type-lifecycle-not-registered`

## 5. Definitions of Done

### FR: UsageType Registration

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-dod-usage-type-lifecycle-fr-usage-type-registration`

The system **MUST** accept a UsageType definition (`gts_id`, `kind: UsageKind`, `metadata_fields`) on `POST /usage-collector/v1/usage-types` or via the SDK trait method `UsageCollectorClientV1::create_usage_type` (both surfaces converge on the same gateway domain service); reject any `gts_id` that does not derive from the reserved abstract base `gts.cf.core.uc.usage_record.v1~` at the `UsageTypeGtsId::new` boundary (REST: the handler returns the canonical `InvalidArgument` `Problem` envelope at HTTP `400` with `field_violations[0].field="gts_id"` and `.reason="INVALID_BASE_GTS_ID"` from the failed conversion on `CreateUsageTypeRequest::gts_id` — whose DTO field is a permissive `String`; SDK: `UsageCollectorError::InvalidArgument` (`ValidationReason::InvalidBaseGtsId`) from `UsageTypeGtsId::new`) and reject any unknown `kind` value at the `UsageKind::from_str` boundary (REST: the handler returns the canonical `InvalidArgument` `Problem` envelope at HTTP `400` with `field_violations[0].field="kind"` and `.reason="VALIDATION"` from the failed parse on the permissive `CreateUsageTypeRequest::kind` DTO field; SDK: `UsageCollectorError::InvalidArgument` (`ValidationReason::Validation`) from `UsageKind::from_str`), both before any plugin dispatch; validate the well-typed payload via `cpt-cf-usage-collector-algo-usage-type-lifecycle-usage-type-shape-validation` for malformed `metadata_fields` before any plugin dispatch, persist the new catalog entry (`gts_id` plus the `kind` enum and the typed `metadata_fields` array of strings — `gts_id` and `kind` are independent) by dispatching the catalog write through `cpt-cf-usage-collector-contract-storage-plugin` inside a transaction, and surface a deterministic `UsageTypeAlreadyExists` envelope (HTTP `409` canonical `AlreadyExists` with `Problem.context.resource_type="gts.cf.core.uc.usage_type.v1~"` and `Problem.context.resource.name=<gts_id>` carrying the offending identifier) when the plugin's unique constraint on `gts_id` fires so retried submissions of the same `gts_id` never produce silent duplication or partial catalog mutation.

### FR: UsageType Deletion

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-dod-usage-type-lifecycle-fr-usage-type-deletion`

The system **MUST** implement `DELETE /usage-collector/v1/usage-types/{gts_id}` and the SDK trait method `UsageCollectorClientV1::delete_usage_type` (both surfaces converge on the same gateway domain service) per the referential-delete protocol of §"Delete UsageType" — PDP authorize, dispatch the catalog delete through `cpt-cf-usage-collector-contract-storage-plugin` so that: a `UsageTypeNotFound` SPI error ⇒ canonical not-found `Problem` envelope (HTTP `404`, `resource.type="usage_type"`, `resource.id=<gts_id>`); a `UsageTypeReferenced { gts_id, sample_ref_count }` SPI error (the plugin's `ON DELETE RESTRICT` FK on `usage_records.gts_id` rejected the delete because at least one row references the `gts_id`) ⇒ canonical conflict `Problem` envelope (HTTP `409`, `reason="USAGE_TYPE_REFERENCED"`, `resource.type="usage_type"`, `resource.id=<gts_id>`, `detail` carrying the human-readable reference count; `sample_ref_count` is NOT exposed as a structured `context.sample_ref_count` field); a successful row removal ⇒ `204 No Content`. The implementation MUST NOT introduce a tombstone, a state column, or a second transaction.

**Implements**:

- `cpt-cf-usage-collector-flow-usage-type-lifecycle-delete-usage-type`

**Constraints**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-fr-usage-type-deletion`

**Touches**:

- Entities: `UsageType`

### FR: Counter Semantics

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-dod-usage-type-lifecycle-fr-counter-semantics`

The system **MUST** classify a UsageType whose registered `kind` is `UsageKind::Counter` as a non-negative delta accumulation UsageType (counter / gauge classification carried by the closed `UsageKind` enum on the catalog row). The §2.3 Usage Emission ingestion path resolves UsageType existence by dispatching `get_usage_type` directly against `cpt-cf-usage-collector-contract-storage-plugin` and reads the counter classification at the call site from `UsageType.kind` via the `UsageType::is_counter` predicate so that the non-negative-delta invariant is enforced without re-implementing semantics locally; counter / gauge classification is carried verbatim as the row's `kind` field on every catalog read.

**Implements**:

- `cpt-cf-usage-collector-algo-usage-type-lifecycle-usage-type-shape-validation`

**Constraints**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-fr-counter-semantics`

**Touches**:

- Entities: `UsageType`

### FR: Gauge Semantics

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-dod-usage-type-lifecycle-fr-gauge-semantics`

The system **MUST** classify a UsageType whose registered `kind` is `UsageKind::Gauge` as a point-in-time UsageType stored as-is (counter / gauge classification carried by the closed `UsageKind` enum on the catalog row). The §2.3 Usage Emission ingestion path resolves UsageType existence by dispatching `get_usage_type` directly against `cpt-cf-usage-collector-contract-storage-plugin` and reads the gauge classification at the call site from `UsageType.kind` via the `UsageType::is_gauge` predicate so gauge values are accepted without delta-accumulation rewriting; counter / gauge classification is carried verbatim as the row's `kind` field on every catalog read.

### NFR: Availability

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-dod-usage-type-lifecycle-nfr-availability`

The system **MUST** keep the read endpoints `GET /usage-collector/v1/usage-types` and `GET /usage-collector/v1/usage-types/{gts_id}` (and their SDK trait counterparts `UsageCollectorClientV1::list_usage_types` / `get_usage_type`) available whenever the bound storage plugin is available — catalog reads dispatch through `cpt-cf-usage-collector-contract-storage-plugin` against the plugin's `usage_type_catalog` table per call. When the plugin is unavailable, the read endpoints surface deterministic platform-error envelopes (HTTP `503` for `PluginUnavailable` / `TypesRegistryUnavailable` / `ServiceUnavailable` (plugin-side `Transient` and host-side per-call deadline expirations both lift to `ServiceUnavailable`); HTTP `500` for plugin `BackendError` (lifted to `Internal`)) per `usage-collector-v1.yaml`, and the SDK trait surface returns the matching `UsageCollectorError` variant. Plugin binding is lazy (resolved on first dispatch via the `GtsPluginSelector`), and gear init does not block on plugin readiness — the plugin's availability is observed per-call via the `usage_collector.plugin.ready` gauge but is NOT a hard gear-readiness gate that withholds the REST router from the gateway.

**Implements**:

- `cpt-cf-usage-collector-flow-usage-type-lifecycle-list-usage-types`

- Entities: `UsageType`

### Principle: Semantics Enforcement

- [x] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-dod-usage-type-lifecycle-principle-semantics-enforcement`

The system **MUST** enforce UsageType semantics invariants at the catalog boundary: every UsageType registration validates that the supplied `gts_id` derives from the reserved abstract base `gts.cf.core.uc.usage_record.v1~` at the `UsageTypeGtsId::new` boundary before any repo dispatch (REST: the handler returns the canonical `InvalidArgument` `Problem` envelope at HTTP `400` with `field_violations[0].field="gts_id"` and `.reason="INVALID_BASE_GTS_ID"` from the failed conversion on `CreateUsageTypeRequest::gts_id` — whose DTO field is a permissive `String`; SDK: `UsageCollectorError::InvalidArgument` (`ValidationReason::InvalidBaseGtsId`) returned by `UsageTypeGtsId::new`) and validates `kind` as a closed `UsageKind` enum at the `UsageKind::from_str` boundary (REST: the handler returns the canonical `InvalidArgument` `Problem` envelope at HTTP `400` with `field_violations[0].field="kind"` and `.reason="VALIDATION"` from the failed parse on the permissive `CreateUsageTypeRequest::kind` DTO field; SDK: `UsageCollectorError::InvalidArgument` (`ValidationReason::Validation`) returned by `UsageKind::from_str`), and every read-side consumer obtains catalog membership for a `gts_id` exclusively by dispatching `get_usage_type` against `cpt-cf-usage-collector-contract-storage-plugin` and reads counter / gauge classification at the call site from the catalog row's `kind` field via the `UsageType::is_counter` / `UsageType::is_gauge` predicates so that ingestion (`cpt-cf-usage-collector-fr-counter-semantics`, `cpt-cf-usage-collector-fr-gauge-semantics`) and aggregation-query validation never re-implement classification semantics locally.

**Implements**:

- Entities: `UsageType`

### Constraint: No Business Logic

- [x] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-dod-usage-type-lifecycle-constraint-no-business-logic`

The system **MUST** keep the UsageType Catalog free of **per-UsageType business-rule fields**: the catalog entry carries `gts_id`, `kind`, and `metadata_fields` (closed `array<string>` of declared metadata key names) with no tenant scoping, and **MUST NOT** introduce accounting / billing / per-UsageType value-rule fields. Counter / gauge classification is carried by the closed `kind: UsageKind` enum; it is a classification discriminator, not a business-rule field. Carrying a closed `metadata_fields` declaration is **metadata-shape typing**, not business logic — it constrains payload shape. Every per-UsageType business rule (counter/gauge value enforcement on the ingestion path, accounting interpretation, billing transforms) remains owned by callers and downstream consumers — never by the catalog.

**Implements**:

### Component: UsageType Catalog

- [x] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-dod-usage-type-lifecycle-component-usage-type-catalog`

The system **MUST** realize `cpt-cf-usage-collector-component-usage-type-catalog` as the sole owner of the unified UsageType catalog — a single catalog persisted in the plugin's `usage_type_catalog` table reached through `cpt-cf-usage-collector-contract-storage-plugin` — plus the UsageType lifecycle entry points (register, list, get, delete) reachable via REST and the SDK trait `UsageCollectorClientV1`. All catalog reads and writes dispatch through the Plugin SPI per call; the plugin SoR is the single source of truth for both the operator-facing catalog endpoints and the ingestion-path UsageType lookup (the ingestion path dispatches `get_usage_type` against the storage plugin SPI per record). On every catalog delete the component MUST surface the plugin's `UsageTypeReferenced { gts_id, sample_ref_count }` SPI error as the canonical conflict `Problem` envelope (HTTP `409`, `reason="USAGE_TYPE_REFERENCED"`, `resource.type="usage_type"`, `resource.id=<gts_id>`, `detail` carrying the human-readable reference count).

### Sequence: Delete UsageType

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-dod-usage-type-lifecycle-seq-delete-usage-type`

The system **MUST** implement the `cpt-cf-usage-collector-seq-delete-usage-type` sequence end-to-end on both the REST and the SDK trait surfaces (`DELETE /usage-collector/v1/usage-types/{gts_id}` and `UsageCollectorClientV1::delete_usage_type`; both surfaces converge on the same gateway domain service) per the referential-delete protocol: PDP authorize → dispatch the catalog delete through `cpt-cf-usage-collector-contract-storage-plugin` → `UsageTypeNotFound` SPI error ⇒ canonical not-found `Problem` envelope (HTTP `404`, `resource.type="usage_type"`, `resource.id=<gts_id>`) → `UsageTypeReferenced { gts_id, sample_ref_count }` SPI error (the plugin's `ON DELETE RESTRICT` FK on `usage_records.gts_id` rejected the delete) ⇒ canonical conflict `Problem` envelope (HTTP `409`, `reason="USAGE_TYPE_REFERENCED"`, `resource.type="usage_type"`, `resource.id=<gts_id>`, `detail` carrying the human-readable reference count; `sample_ref_count` is NOT exposed as a structured `context.sample_ref_count` field) → successful plugin row removal ⇒ `204 No Content` (REST) / `Ok(())` (SDK). The implementation MUST NOT introduce a tombstone, a state column, or a second transaction.

### Entity: UsageType

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-dod-usage-type-lifecycle-entity-usage-type`

The system **MUST** treat `UsageType` as the platform-global, identity-bearing UsageType definition keyed by `gts_id` (the human-readable `gts_id` is a unique `UsageTypeGtsId` newtype whose `Deserialize` impl rejects any string that does not derive from the reserved abstract base `gts.cf.core.uc.usage_record.v1~` with at least one further `~`-separated segment). The entity is described by its closed `metadata_fields: array<string>` (declared metadata key names; all values typed as `String` end-to-end) and its `kind: UsageKind` (closed counter / gauge enum carrying the row's classification). Counter / gauge semantics — `counter` (non-negative delta accumulation) and `gauge` (point-in-time, stored as-is) per DESIGN §3.1 — are carried by the closed `UsageKind` enum on the catalog row's `kind` field per ADR 0012's 2026-06-08 amendment; counter / gauge classification is a first-class column on the catalog row (`kind`), independent of `gts_id`. The system **MUST** reject any UsageType registration whose `gts_id` does not derive from the reserved abstract base at the `UsageTypeGtsId::new` boundary before any repo dispatch (REST: handler returns the canonical `InvalidArgument` `Problem` envelope at HTTP `400` with `field_violations[0].field="gts_id"` and `.reason="INVALID_BASE_GTS_ID"` from the failed conversion on `CreateUsageTypeRequest::gts_id`; SDK: `UsageCollectorError::InvalidArgument` (`ValidationReason::InvalidBaseGtsId`) from `UsageTypeGtsId::new`); unknown `kind` values are rejected at the `UsageKind::from_str` boundary before any repo dispatch (REST: handler returns the canonical `InvalidArgument` `Problem` envelope at HTTP `400` with `field_violations[0].field="kind"` and `.reason="VALIDATION"` from the failed parse on the permissive `CreateUsageTypeRequest::kind` DTO field; SDK: `UsageCollectorError::InvalidArgument` (`ValidationReason::Validation`) from `UsageKind::from_str`). The entity's identity (`gts_id`) MUST be unique deployment-wide, MUST NOT carry tenant scoping, MUST be validated through the `UsageTypeGtsId` newtype boundary on the REST ingress path, and MUST be re-registrable after a successful clean delete; idempotency-key collisions are not a concern because idempotency-keyed dedup is per (tenant_id, gts_id, idempotency_key) and any surviving `usage_records` rows are tolerated by the catalog deletion.

### API: POST /usage-collector/v1/usage-types

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-dod-usage-type-lifecycle-api-post-usage-types`

The system **MUST** expose `POST /usage-collector/v1/usage-types` as the REST UsageType-registration entry point per `usage-collector-v1.yaml`, accepting the `CreateUsageTypeRequest` payload (`gts_id: String` — a permissive `String` rather than a typed `UsageTypeGtsId` so the handler can produce a deterministic canonical `InvalidArgument` `Problem` envelope from a failed `UsageTypeGtsId::new` conversion; `metadata_fields: Vec<String>`) and returning the canonical `UsageType` resource projected to `UsageTypeDto` for the wire response with a `Location: /usage-collector/v1/usage-types/{gts_id}` header, surfacing deterministic `Problem` envelopes for `403` PDP denial (canonical `PermissionDenied`, `context.reason="AUTHZ"`), `400` `InvalidArgument` with `field_violations[0].field="gts_id"` + `.reason="INVALID_BASE_GTS_ID"` (the request `gts_id` failed `UsageTypeGtsId::new`), `400` `InvalidArgument` with `field_violations[0].field="metadata_fields[{i}]"` + `.reason` one of `INVALID_METADATA_FIELDS_EMPTY_STRING` / `INVALID_METADATA_FIELDS_DUPLICATE` (malformed `metadata_fields`), `409` canonical `AlreadyExists` with `context.resource_type="gts.cf.core.uc.usage_type.v1~"` + `context.resource.name=<gts_id>` when the plugin's unique constraint on `gts_id` fires, and propagated platform-error envelopes for upstream resolver or plugin SPI failures. The handler returns `ApiResult` and emits the canonical envelope unmodified; there is no Problem-layer post-injection of parallel `context.*` discriminator keys. The same operation is reachable via the SDK trait method `UsageCollectorClientV1::create_usage_type(ctx, UsageType)`, which accepts a typed `UsageType { gts_id: UsageTypeGtsId, metadata_fields }` directly and therefore cannot reach the bad-`gts_id`-prefix path (bad-prefix `gts_id` is rejected at `UsageTypeGtsId::new` and surfaces as `UsageCollectorError::InvalidArgument` (`ValidationReason::InvalidBaseGtsId`)); both surfaces converge on the same gateway domain service.

### API: DELETE /usage-collector/v1/usage-types/{gts_id}

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-dod-usage-type-lifecycle-api-delete-usage-type`

The system **MUST** expose `DELETE /usage-collector/v1/usage-types/{gts_id}` as the REST UsageType-deletion entry point per `usage-collector-v1.yaml`, returning `204 No Content` on a clean delete and deterministic `Problem` envelopes for `403` PDP denial, the canonical not-found envelope when the plugin returns `UsageTypeNotFound` (HTTP `404`, `resource.type="usage_type"`, `resource.id=<gts_id>`), the canonical conflict envelope when the plugin's `ON DELETE RESTRICT` foreign key on `usage_records.gts_id` rejects the delete and surfaces `UsageTypeReferenced { gts_id, sample_ref_count }` (HTTP `409`, `reason="USAGE_TYPE_REFERENCED"`, `resource.type="usage_type"`, `resource.id=<gts_id>`, `detail` carrying the human-readable reference count; `sample_ref_count` is NOT exposed as a structured `context.sample_ref_count` field), and propagated platform-error envelopes for upstream resolver or plugin SPI failures (HTTP `503` for `PluginUnavailable` / `TypesRegistryUnavailable` / `ServiceUnavailable` (plugin-side `Transient` and host-side per-call deadline expirations both lift to `ServiceUnavailable`); HTTP `500` for plugin `BackendError` (lifted to `Internal`)) — never mutating the plugin's `usage_type_catalog` table on any non-`Deleted` outcome. The DELETE handler does NOT route through the POST-only `register_error_to_problem` decorator, so the canonical envelope does not carry a snake_case `Problem.context.reason` discriminator; callers disambiguate via HTTP status, `reason` (when set via `with_reason`), and `resource.*`. The same operation is reachable via the SDK trait method `UsageCollectorClientV1::delete_usage_type`; both surfaces converge on the same gateway domain service.

The same operation is reachable via the SDK trait method `UsageCollectorClientV1::list_usage_types(ctx, &ODataQuery)` where the `ODataQuery` carries the optional `limit` and `cursor` and returns `toolkit_odata::Page<UsageType>` (the SDK-side type, not the REST projection); both surfaces converge on the same gateway domain service.

The same operation is reachable via the SDK trait method `UsageCollectorClientV1::get_usage_type(ctx, gts_id)` (returns the SDK-side `UsageType` directly); both surfaces converge on the same gateway domain service.

### Error Mapping: SPI → REST / SDK

Mapping of usage-type-lifecycle outcomes from the storage plugin SPI surface and the gateway ingest-validation surface onto the canonical RFC-9457 `Problem` envelope and the flat `UsageCollectorError` SDK variant. **All catalog REST handlers (POST / GET / DELETE / LIST) return `ApiResult` and emit the canonical envelope unmodified** — there is no per-operation Problem-layer post-injection. Wire-level discrimination uses the three slots the canonical envelope already provides: `Problem.type` (the canonical category URI), `Problem.context.resource_type` (the GTS resource type — `usage_type` vs `usage_record`), and either `Problem.context.field_violations[N].field`/`.reason` (for `InvalidArgument`) or `Problem.context.reason` (for categories whose canonical context carries it natively — `Aborted`, `PermissionDenied`, `Unauthenticated`). This matches the platform-wide convention used by account-management, nodes-registry, mini-chat, and api-gateway.

**POST `/usage-collector/v1/usage-types`** — validation rejections:

| SPI / gateway outcome             | HTTP  | Canonical category | `field_violations[0].field`   | `field_violations[0].reason`                                              | SDK `UsageCollectorError` variant         |
| --------------------------------- | ----- | ------------------ | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Bad `gts_id` base type prefix     | `400` | `InvalidArgument`  | `gts_id`                      | `INVALID_BASE_GTS_ID`                                                     | `InvalidArgument { reason: InvalidBaseGtsId, .. }` |
| Malformed `metadata_fields` (empty string) | `400` | `InvalidArgument`  | `metadata_fields[{i}]`        | `INVALID_METADATA_FIELDS_EMPTY_STRING`                                    | `InvalidArgument { reason: MetadataFieldEmptyString, .. }` |
| Malformed `metadata_fields` (duplicate)    | `400` | `InvalidArgument`  | `metadata_fields[{i}]`        | `INVALID_METADATA_FIELDS_DUPLICATE`                                       | `InvalidArgument { reason: MetadataFieldDuplicate, .. }` |

The rejected raw value (e.g. the bad `gts_id` string) is carried in `field_violations[0].description` (the human-readable detail) — not duplicated into a parallel `Problem.context.gts_id` field.

**Conflict and authorization** (all catalog handlers — shape is uniform across POST / GET / DELETE / LIST):

| SPI / gateway outcome      | HTTP  | Canonical category   | Discriminator carry                                                                                                                  | SDK `UsageCollectorError` variant      |
| -------------------------- | ----- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| `UsageTypeAlreadyExists`   | `409` | `AlreadyExists`      | `context.resource_type="gts.cf.core.uc.usage_type.v1~"`, `context.resource.name=<gts_id>`                                            | `AlreadyExists`                        |
| `UsageTypeNotFound`        | `404` | `NotFound`           | `context.resource_type="gts.cf.core.uc.usage_type.v1~"`, `context.resource.name=<gts_id>`                                            | `NotFound`                             |
| `UsageTypeReferenced`      | `409` | `Aborted`            | `context.reason="USAGE_TYPE_REFERENCED"`, `context.resource_type="gts.cf.core.uc.usage_type.v1~"`, `context.resource.name=<gts_id>` (human-readable `sample_ref_count` in `detail`; not exposed as structured field) | `Conflict { reason: UsageTypeReferenced, .. }` |
| PDP deny                   | `403` | `PermissionDenied`   | `context.reason="AUTHZ"` (native `with_reason`)                                                                                      | `PermissionDenied`                     |

`AlreadyExists` and `NotFound` are discriminated by category + resource type + resource name; the canonical envelope does not carry a top-level `reason` slot on these categories and the catalog has no further sub-codes worth carrying — the resource identifier IS the actionable signal.

**Ingest path** (consumed by usage-emission, listed here for completeness):

| Gateway outcome                          | HTTP  | `Problem` shape                                                              | SDK `UsageCollectorError` variant |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `UnknownMetadataKey { gts_id, key }`     | `400` | `field_violations[0].reason="UNKNOWN_METADATA_KEY"`, `field_violations[0].field="metadata"` (offending key in the human-readable detail) | `InvalidArgument { reason: UnknownMetadataKey, .. }` |
| `UsageTypeNotFound(gts_id)` (ingest miss) | `404` | canonical not-found; `resource.type="usage_type"`, `resource.id=<gts_id>`     | `NotFound`                         |

**Plugin transport / availability failures** (all surfaces):

| SPI outcome                                | HTTP  | SDK `UsageCollectorError` variant |
| ------------------------------------------ | ----- | --------------------------------- |
| `PluginUnavailable`                        | `503` | `PluginUnavailable`               |
| `TypesRegistryUnavailable`                 | `503` | `TypesRegistryUnavailable`        |
| Plugin `Transient { detail }` or host-side per-call deadline | `503` | `ServiceUnavailable`              |
| Plugin `BackendError { kind, detail }`     | `500` | `Internal("{kind}: {detail}")`    |

The SPI no longer carves a separate `Timeout` variant — downstream timeouts surface as plugin-side `Transient` (lifted to `ServiceUnavailable`); host-side per-call deadline expirations also surface as `ServiceUnavailable`.

Plugin `BackendError` lifts to the unclassified `Internal` envelope (HTTP 500) until a documented retryable-kind taxonomy is defined; once real plugins ship with one, retryable kinds will route to dedicated `#[non_exhaustive]` SDK variants.

The bad-`gts_id`-prefix envelope is produced by the REST POST handler from a failed `UsageTypeGtsId::new` conversion on the inbound `CreateUsageTypeRequest::gts_id` (whose DTO field is a permissive `String`). The SDK trait's `create_usage_type` takes a typed `UsageType { gts_id: UsageTypeGtsId, ... }` and therefore cannot reach this path on the SDK side; bad prefixes surface as `UsageCollectorError::InvalidArgument` (`ValidationReason::InvalidBaseGtsId`) from `UsageTypeGtsId::new` directly.

## 6. Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `p1` - After a successful `POST /usage-collector/v1/usage-types` with a valid `UsageType` (`gts_id`, `metadata_fields`), a subsequent `GET /usage-collector/v1/usage-types/{gts_id}` returns the canonical `UsageType` resource (projected to `UsageTypeDto` on the wire) whose `gts_id` and `metadata_fields` are byte-identical to the persisted catalog entry (and whose `kind` classification matches the registration payload), and a `GET /usage-collector/v1/usage-types` page includes that same entry with the same field values (catalog round-trip correctness).
- [ ] `p1` - Every `POST /usage-collector/v1/usage-types` / `DELETE /usage-collector/v1/usage-types/{gts_id}` REST call and every `UsageCollectorClientV1::create_usage_type` / `delete_usage_type` SDK trait call accepts a resolved `SecurityContext` (REST: `Extension<SecurityContext>` populated by ToolKit gateway middleware via `OperationBuilder::authenticated()`; SDK: `&SecurityContext` argument) at the surface boundary and dispatches authorization through `cpt-cf-usage-collector-flow-foundation-pdp-authorize` (per-component `authorize` helper against `cpt-cf-usage-collector-contract-authz-resolver`) before any plugin SPI dispatch — both surfaces converge on the shared gateway domain service; a PDP `deny` decision returns the platform-authorization error envelope (HTTP `403` on REST, `UsageCollectorError` on SDK) and leaves the durable `usage_type_catalog` row count unchanged (PDP gating).
- [ ] `p1` - A `DELETE /usage-collector/v1/usage-types/{gts_id}` (or `UsageCollectorClientV1::delete_usage_type`) whose target UsageType has zero referencing usage records removes the catalog entry via the plugin SPI catalog-delete dispatch; on any non-`Deleted` outcome (canonical 404 not-found envelope for `UsageTypeNotFound`, canonical 409 conflict envelope with `reason="USAGE_TYPE_REFERENCED"` for `UsageTypeReferenced`, or any platform-error envelope) the plugin's catalog entry is unchanged (referential-delete protocol).
- [ ] `p1` - A `POST /usage-collector/v1/usage-types` whose supplied `gts_id` does not derive from the reserved abstract base `gts.cf.core.uc.usage_record.v1~` (or is missing a derivation segment after the base) returns HTTP `400` with the canonical `InvalidArgument` `Problem` envelope (`context.field_violations[0].field="gts_id"`, `.reason="INVALID_BASE_GTS_ID"`, `.description` echoing the rejected identifier), produced by the REST handler from a failed `UsageTypeGtsId::new` conversion on the inbound `CreateUsageTypeRequest::gts_id` (whose DTO field is a permissive `String`). The SDK equivalent `UsageCollectorClientV1::create_usage_type` is unreachable with a bad-base `gts_id` because the typed `UsageType` argument carries a `UsageTypeGtsId` newtype whose constructor (`UsageTypeGtsId::new`) returns `UsageCollectorError::InvalidArgument` (`ValidationReason::InvalidBaseGtsId`) on a non-derived identifier. Either way no plugin dispatch happens and the plugin's `usage_type_catalog` table is unchanged (base-derivation enforcement at the `UsageTypeGtsId::new` boundary).
- [ ] `p1` - `GET /usage-collector/v1/usage-types` / `UsageCollectorClientV1::list_usage_types` and `GET /usage-collector/v1/usage-types/{gts_id}` / `UsageCollectorClientV1::get_usage_type` are served via a paginated/single-row dispatch through `cpt-cf-usage-collector-contract-storage-plugin` against the unified usage-type catalog per call; when the bound plugin is unavailable the endpoints surface deterministic 503 / 500 platform-error envelopes (`PluginUnavailable` / `TypesRegistryUnavailable` / `ServiceUnavailable` ⇒ 503; plugin `BackendError` ⇒ 500 via `Internal`), `cpt-cf-usage-collector-dod-usage-type-lifecycle-api-list-usage-types`, and `cpt-cf-usage-collector-dod-usage-type-lifecycle-api-get-usage-type` — the gear does not withhold the REST router on plugin absence (plugin binding is lazy).
- [ ] `p1` - **Given** the catalog contains a registered UsageType `T` whose `metadata_fields = ["region"]`, **when** any caller submits a usage row carrying `gts_id = T` and `metadata = { "region": "eu-west-1" }`, **then** the gateway ingest-metadata-validation algorithm resolves the declared keys via a plugin SoR round-trip, verifies every candidate key is a member of `metadata_fields`, and accepts the row for plugin dispatch (ingest success).
- [ ] `p1` - **Given** the catalog contains a registered UsageType `T` whose `metadata_fields = ["region"]`, **when** any caller submits a usage row carrying `gts_id = T` and `metadata = { "region": "eu-west-1", "extra_tag": "x" }`, **then** the gateway ingest-metadata-validation algorithm returns HTTP `400` with a `Problem` envelope whose `field_violations[0].reason = "UNKNOWN_METADATA_KEY"` and `field_violations[0].field = "metadata"` (the offending key `extra_tag` carried in the human-readable detail), no plugin write dispatch occurs, and no `usage_records` row is mutated (ingest rejection).
- [ ] `p1` - **Given** the catalog contains a registered UsageType `L` and the plugin's `usage_records` table holds at least one row whose `gts_id = L`, **when** an operator calls `DELETE /usage-collector/v1/usage-types/{gts_id}` (or `UsageCollectorClientV1::delete_usage_type`) for `L`, **then** the plugin's `ON DELETE RESTRICT` foreign key rejects the delete inside the same transaction and surfaces `UsageTypeReferenced { gts_id: L, sample_ref_count }`, the gateway returns the canonical conflict `Problem` envelope (HTTP `409`, `reason="USAGE_TYPE_REFERENCED"`, `resource.type="usage_type"`, `resource.id=L`, `detail` carrying the human-readable reference count; `sample_ref_count` is NOT exposed as a structured `context.sample_ref_count` field), no `usage_type_catalog` row is removed, and no `usage_records` row is mutated (referential-delete rejection).
