//! Background self-registration (directory presence) for `OoP` gears
//! (`cpt-cf-component-oop-bootstrap`).
//!
//! **Presence** ([`presence_loop`]) is the single owner of this instance's
//! `DirectoryService` presence. It registers the instance's gRPC/REST endpoints
//! and `OpenAPI` spec (retrying with exponential backoff, 100ms → 30s cap), then
//! runs one loop that both sends periodic **heartbeats** (the steady-state
//! liveness signal the directory uses to keep the instance routable) and
//! periodically **re-registers** to self-heal after a `DirectoryService` restart
//! / connection loss. Consolidating both into one task (owned by the `OoP` serve
//! lifecycle) avoids the split-brain where an independent heartbeat task and a
//! re-registration task raced to write conflicting liveness state onto the same
//! directory record.
//!
//! Dependency resolution is **not** here: consumers are wired by the
//! proxy-wiring phase via typed `#[toolkit::consumes]` directory-resolving
//! clients, which feed the shared
//! [`DependencyChecker`](super::readiness::DependencyChecker) that gates
//! `/readyz`.
